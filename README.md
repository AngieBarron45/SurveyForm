# SurveyForm.📝
## This is a Survey Form project to get user feedback.⚡
#### To build this project I used different elements, attributes, and values to create fields with different input types, such as; text, number (age), select, and so on.
#### Radio and checkbox inputs were also placed, as well as background design and mirror filter on the page body to make it striking and soft at the same time.
